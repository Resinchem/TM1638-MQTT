A general MQTT wrapper framework for the [TM1638Plus library](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/TM1638plus), designed for installation on the ESP8266 family of microcontrollers.  It has been designed using Model 1 of the TM1638 display board (shown above) and it *has not been tested* on other models.

In addition to providing MQTT wrapper functions, the framework also provides the following:
* Wifi, MQTT and option setting via header files - no need to write or modify code
* Over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities (after initial load)
* Clock and date modes, plus other examples included in the code

While designed primarily for use with Home Assistant as an alternative to ESPHome, it should function with any MQTT broker or application.  For information on wiring and more, please see the following:

#### This is still very much a work in progress!  There may be frequent updates, depending upon interest and support.
